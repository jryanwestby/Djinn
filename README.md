# Djinn
Djinn is a mashup of Space Invaders and Tetronimoes written in Java using OpenGL, lwjgl, and Slick2D. 

In Djinn, both space invaders and tetronimoes are played simultaneously. The arrow keys control movement of the player in the Space Invaders half of the screen, while WASD controls movement and rotation of the tetronimoes. The spacebar shoots a player shot while simultaneously slamming the tetronimo block. 

To win the game, all enemies must be eliminated. This must be done while at the same time managing the tetronimo portion of the screen. Game over occurs when the player has been shot by an enemy enough times to run out of lives, or when the tetronimoes fill the screen.

Below are screens of the game in action.
