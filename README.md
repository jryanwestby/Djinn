# Djinn
Djinn is a mashup of Space Invaders and Tetronimoes written in Java using OpenGL, lwjgl, and Slick2D. 

Both games must be played simultaneously. The arrow keys control movement of the player in the Space Invaders half of the screen, while WASD control movement and rotation of the tetronimoes. The spacebar shoots a player shot while simultaneously slamming the tetronimo block. To win the game, all enemies must be eliminated. Game over occurs when the player has been shot by an enemy enough times to run out of lives, or when the tetronimoes fill the screen.

To play the game, download the .zip from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/jryanwestby/Djinn/releases) and run the .jar file. Have fun and good luck!

Below are screens of the game in action.
